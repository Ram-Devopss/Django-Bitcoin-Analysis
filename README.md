# BitCoin Prediction Model with Historical and Current Year Graphical Plots

This Django-based project predicts Bitcoin prices based on historical data and provides graphical plots of both past years and current year predictions.

## 📊 Graphical Representation
The model showcases graphical plots of historical years and includes predictions for the current year. A sample plot image is provided to visualize the prediction trends over time.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: To handle numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for model building and splitting the dataset using `train_test_split`.
- **Linear Regression**: The core algorithm to predict Bitcoin prices.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the graphical representation of the prediction model.
- **Requests**: To fetch external data as needed for the model.

## 💻 Installation
To get started, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib requests
```
